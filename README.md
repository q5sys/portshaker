# portshaker

## Description

The `portshaker` utility maintains a set of *target* ports trees containing
ports provided by *source* ports trees.

A single *target* ports tree can contain ports from any number of *source*
ports trees. If a port is provided by more than one *source* ports tree,
`portshaker` will merge the latest version of this port in the *target* ports
tree.

As `portshaker` can maintain any number of *target* ports tree, it is
particularly handy if you want to use customized ports trees with tinderbox /
poudriere.

## Using portshaker

For install instructions, please refer to the INSTALL file.  After installing,
you will have to configure `portshaker(8)` since it is a toolkit and does nothing
out of the box.  Configuration instructions are provided in the distribution
man pages: `portshaker(8)`, `portshaker.conf(5)` and `portshaker.d(5)`.

IN ORDER TO PRODUCE REPRODUCTIBLE RESULTS, THE `PORTSHAKER(8)` PROGRAM'S FIRST
ACTION WHEN MERGING PORTS IS TO RESET THE DESTINATION PORTS TREE.  AS A
CONSEQUENCE, IF YOU HAVE LOCAL EDITS IN YOUR TARGET PORTS TREE, THEY WILL BE
LOST (AND SO DO ANY OTHER FILE IN THE DIRECTORY, E.G. VCS CONTROL FILES).
